# Contributing

## Workflow
- Fork the repository to your own account.
- Create a new branch for each change instead of working on `main`.
- Keep each branch scoped to one change or one tightly related set of changes.
- When behavior, config, CLI flags, or the public API change, update the relevant docs, refresh the example config if needed, and add or adjust tests to cover the change.

## Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/skylvie/veyl
cd veyl
pnpm install
pnpm build
```
If you are contributing from a fork, push your work to your fork and open a PR from that branch.

## Common Commands
```sh
pnpm cli # `node packages/cli/dist/index.js`
pnpm dev # vite dev (`packages/app`)
pnpm preview # vite preview (`packages/app`)
pnpm test # run test suite
pnpm lint # biome
pnpm lint:fix # biome
pnpm format # biome
pnpm check # biome
pnpm typecheck # typecheck all packages
pnpm build # build all packages
```

## Required Checks
Before opening a PR, make sure your changes pass:
```sh
pnpm check
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

## Testing
```sh
pnpm test

# Flags
pnpm test --keep-js # Keep all JS output
pnpm test --keep-out # Keep `out.js`
